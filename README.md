`pm2-dashboard-lite` is an AngularJS-based application that parses the JSON generated by [PM2's web interface](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2/).

## Installation

Clone this repository to a directory from which you can serve HTML. As there is no dynamically generated content, you can serve this through static file hosts, including GitHub pages and Amazon's S3.

Run the included application by passing the `feedUrl` parameter with an URL to a PM2 web interface JSON feed.

For example, if you are running a feed on `pm2.acme.com:9615`, you would pass the parameter like so: `/index.html#/?feedUrl=http:%2F%pm2.acme.com:9615%2F`. 

## Security

This application does not provide any security. It is up to you to decide if and how you want to secure the data. 

Keep in mind that this application simply visualizes the JSON data, it does not make it available. This is done through PM2 and as such, securing the feed should be done on the server on which PM2 is running on.

## History

This application was built to showcase some of Angular's rapid prototyping features. While it has been running at `$dayJob` for a few weeks now, it only provides topical monitoring and is not meant to replace actual monitoring systems.
